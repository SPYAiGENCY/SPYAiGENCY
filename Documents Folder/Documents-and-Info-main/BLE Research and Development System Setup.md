# BLE Research and Development System Setup

## Next Steps: System Dependencies and Hardware Setup

### 1. **Software Dependencies for Ubuntu**
Before diving into BLE development, you need to set up your system. Follow the steps below to install the required software packages:

- **System Update:** Make sure your system is up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues with the BLE stack.
  
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

- **Bluetooth Stack Installation:** Install the BlueZ Bluetooth stack, which includes the necessary tools for BLE communication.

```bash
sudo apt install bluez bluez-tools -y
```

- **Additional Bluetooth Tools:** Install `bluetoothctl`, `hcitool`, and `gatttool` to interact with BLE devices.

```bash
sudo apt install bluez-tools gatttool
```

- **Python Libraries for BLE Communication:** Install essential Python libraries like `pybluez` and `bluepy` for higher-level BLE programming.

```bash
pip install pybluez bluepy
```

- **Development Libraries:** Install `libglib2.0-dev` and `libboost-dev` for additional support in development environments.

```bash
sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev libboost-dev
```

- **Wireshark for Bluetooth Analysis:** Install Wireshark to monitor and analyze BLE packets for debugging purposes.

```bash
sudo apt install wireshark -y
```

### 2. **Hardware Requirements for BLE Research**
To begin testing and developing your BLE application, the following hardware components are recommended:

- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Dongle:** If your machine lacks BLE support, use an external dongle such as:
  - **CSR 4.0 USB Bluetooth Adapter**
  - **Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 Dongle** (ideal for BLE-specific development)
  
- **Development Board with BLE Support:** A microcontroller or development board is crucial for testing and debugging:
  - **ESP32**: Widely used for BLE development.
  - **Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 Series**: Best for BLE-centric projects.

- **Testing Tools:**
  - **Mobile Apps:** Tools like **nRF Connect** and **LightBlue Explorer** help interact with BLE devices and test communication protocols.
  - **Power Supply:** Ensure a stable power source, especially for low-energy applications.

### 3. **System Setup Instructions**
#### a. **Install System Dependencies**
To ensure that all software dependencies are properly installed, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bluez bluez-tools gatttool pybluez bluepy libglib2.0-dev libboost-dev build-essential wireshark -y
```

#### b. **Verify Bluetooth Functionality**
Once all dependencies are installed, verify that Bluetooth is functional by using `bluetoothctl`:

```bash
bluetoothctl
```

From within `bluetoothctl`, use the following commands to scan for and pair with nearby BLE devices:

```bash
power on
agent on
scan on
```

#### c. **BLE Device Communication**
Use `gatttool` to interact with BLE devices:

```bash
gatttool -b <device_MAC_address> -I
```

You can also use Python libraries like `pybluez` or `bluepy` for more advanced BLE interactions in your application.

## Actionable Steps
**Choose your focus area:**
1. **Set up the software environment**:
   - Follow the installation steps for dependencies.
2. **Prepare the hardware**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary BLE dongles and development boards.
3. **Verify communication**:
   - Test device interaction using `bluetoothctl` or `gatttool`.
