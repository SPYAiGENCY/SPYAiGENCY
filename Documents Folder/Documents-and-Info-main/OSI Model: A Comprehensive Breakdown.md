## 1. Introduction
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a networking system into seven distinct layers. It is widely used for research and development to understand, design, and troubleshoot network protocols and systems.

## 2. Overview of the OSI Model
The OSI model divides networking into **seven layers**, each responsible for specific tasks in data communication. These layers ensure interoperability, scalability, and modularity in network design.

### OSI Model Layers
| Layer Number | Layer Name        | Primary Function                      |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 7            | Application       | User-facing network services          |
| 6            | Presentation      | Data translation and encryption       |
| 5            | Session           | Connection management                 |
| 4            | Transport         | Reliable data transfer                |
| 3            | Network           | Routing and addressing                |
| 2            | Data Link         | Frame transmission and error control  |
| 1            | Physical          | Transmission of raw bits              |
